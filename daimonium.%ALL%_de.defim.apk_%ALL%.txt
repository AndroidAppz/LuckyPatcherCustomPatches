[BEGIN]
Version: 3.8.x

Description: patch will unlock any module from Defim (no guarantees that it will work above 3.8.x versions)

Warning! Read carefully instructions below!

• You should deactivate all unpatched modules from Defim before patching, because they contain hook to prevent to be patched via Lucky Patcher

• If some unpatched module was activated in Xposed Installer, so you need to refresh custom patches because of corrupted daimonium.%ALL%_de.defim.apk_%ALL%.txt in Lucky Patcher's data folder (you may delete this file manually, it will be recreated then)

• Modules won't see Lucky Patcher after patching

Protection: license validation (pattern #1), interference with Lucky Patcher (pattern #2), odex deleting at system boot (doesn't affect on ART), package's signature validation (pattern was dismissed, so don't try to rebuild apk)

Creator: Daimonium
